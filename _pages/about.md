I research large language models (LLMs) as an MSc student at <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/en/'>EPFL</a>. I’m fortunate to have worked at the href='#'>NLP</a>, href='#'>DHLAB</a>, href='#'>LINX</a> labs. I did my Bachelor’s at <a href='https://www.polito.it/'>Politecnico di Torino</a>.

### Research Interests
I research making LLMs more useful, e.g., by improving their capabilities. Below are some areas directions I have been working on and interested in:

- Multilinguality: Language Identification, Multilingual Data Collection (cite ...)
- LLM's Reasoning: Overthinking Mitigation, ...
